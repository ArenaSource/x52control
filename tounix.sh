# when no path is given the current working directory is used.
# the script recurses over the given (or current) path (except .git directories)
# and modifies all *.c, *.cp, *.cpp, *.h which are regular files and contain text
# only. it won't process files which names contain colons or backslashes
# (quotes and spaces in file or directory names will work)
